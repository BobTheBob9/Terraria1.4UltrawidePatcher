# Terraria1.4UltrawidePatcher
Patches terraria 1.4 to prevent forced zooming in ultrawide and other resolutions that suffer from forced zoom

Just extract .exe and .dll files into main Terraria folder and then drag-and-drop the Terraria.exe onto the extracted .exe file.
If there's an Terraria update then just remove Terraria-unpacked.exe.
